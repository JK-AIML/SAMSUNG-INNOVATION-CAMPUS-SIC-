🚦 Bangalore Traffic Decongestion using Data Analytics

📌 Overview

This project aims to analyze Bangalore's traffic patterns using data analytics and visualization techniques. By identifying congestion hotspots and traffic trends, we propose insights that can help improve urban mobility.

📊 Features

- **Traffic Data Analysis**: Cleaning and processing Bangalore's traffic dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generating bar plots to highlight congestion trends.
- **Insights**: Identifying key factors contributing to traffic congestion.

📈 Bar Plots

The `bar_plots.py` script creates visual representations of traffic data, such as:

- Peak traffic hours across different zones.
- Vehicle distribution in congested areas.
- Comparison of weekday vs. weekend traffic patterns.

📌 Future Enhancements

- Implementing predictive modeling for traffic flow.
- Integrate real-time traffic APIs.

🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Visualization Tools
